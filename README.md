# PPT-Driven Notes of SQAT



## 1. Introduction to Software QA and Testing

**The Purpose for Testing** is not to prove anything specific, but to **reduce the risk of using the software**

> If our goal is to demonstrate that a program has no errors, then we will be steered subconsciously toward this goal; that is, we tend to select test data that have a low probability of causing the program to fail. On the other hand, if our goal is to demonstrate that a program has errors, our test data will have a higher probability of finding errors. The latter approach will add more value to the program than the former.



### Basic Terminology

- Errors (or mistakes) â€“ A problem that is introduced into a system during development. 
- Faults (defects) - A result of an error. 
  - If a designer makes an error that adds something that we donâ€™t want, the fault is incorrect execution. 
  - If a designer makes an error that misses out something, then the fault is something that is not in the software. 
- Failures â€“ The result when a fault executes. 
- Incidents â€“ The symptoms that indicates that there is a fault. 



#### Relationship

System(Errors â†’ Faults â†’ Failures) â†’ User(Incidents)




### TESTING is a vital part of development

- Make sure people build things with right tools and methods
- Make sure the system has a sensible architecture 
- Use walkthroughs to make sure we agree on what is being done and how it is being done 

**TESTING should balance time, money and quality**



### Joel's Example

- Testing checks your daily building
- Testing shows that bugs have been fixed 
- Testing indicates how you are doing against the schedule
- Testing validates development against the specification
- Usability testing checks you are building what users want



### Software Quality Management

> Software Quality Management is concerned with ensuring that developed software systems are â€˜fit for purpose.â€™ 

- We need processes and standards that should help a team to develop high-quality products 
- We need to check that the processes and standards have been followed 
- We will be thinking further about Software Quality and how it can be managed
